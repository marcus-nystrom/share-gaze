trackers–evaluation, tools, and advice", Behavior Research Methods.

The software is intended to provide code and examples on how multiple eye-tracker systems can be managed and controlled over a network.

The software is written in Python and PsychoPy, and has been tested on RED-m eye trackers from SensoMotoric Instruments (Teltow, Germany). 
The software consists of two parts:

1)  sync_clocks: Software to set the clock time and resolution on the client computers.

2) latency_reliability_test: Evaluating the latency and reliability when sharing gaze data in real-time across multiple computers.

3) demo_shared_gaze: A minimal working example to share and display gaze in real-time across multiple eye-trackers.
